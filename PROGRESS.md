## Last session
(See docs/devlog.md for full session history — this is just the pointer.)

Date: 2026-07-30
Completed: 6.3 — Portal split. VITE_PORTAL config (src/config/portal.ts) with validate/fail-loud; per-portal route modules (src/portals/{admin,cloud,onprem}/routes.tsx) importing only their own pages; router selects children off the inlined env literal so Rollup DCEs the other portals. Portal↔account_type guard layered into RequireAuth (WrongPortal screen). Removed superseded RouteGuard. Sidebar shows the portal name. Verified: typecheck/lint green; all three VITE_PORTAL builds green; per-bundle grep confirms Overview only in admin, Namespaces only in onprem (no cross-portal leakage).
Decisions made: D-035, D-036
Known issues: — (cloud Supabase project URL/keys still to be created by user; metrics still mock via external_ref bridge until 6.5)
