Date: 2026-07-31
Completed: R2b — feature flags now work at four scopes (global | cluster | namespace | org; added cluster; D-053; mock-only, D-027). FlagScope enum extended; the single FeatureFlagsPanel (no fork) takes scope+entityId+entityName; useFeatureFlags(scope,entityId)/fetchFeatureFlags(scope,entityId); scope badge gained a Cluster pill. +3 cluster-scoped mock flags; global returns the whole pool, a scope returns global+that scope. New super_admin-gated "Edit feature flags" affordances on each cluster group header + the namespace detail header (D-006). The 3 existing triggers updated to scope="org"/global (behavior unchanged). Verified: tsx unit-check of all four scope fetches; typecheck/lint/build green; interactive open-per-scope code-complete + build-verified (not headlessly click-asserted). R2 complete (R2a + R2b).
Decisions made: D-053
Known issues: — (cloud Supabase project URL/keys still user-provided; metrics still mock via external_ref bridge until 6.5)
