Date: 2026-07-31
Completed: R1 — unify the three portals into ONE app with a single /login (reverses 6.3; supersedes D-026/D-035; D-048). Merged all routes into one router with per-route RouteGuard → AccessDenied; deleted the portals/ route modules, config/portal.ts, WrongPortal.tsx; retired VITE_PORTAL. RequireAuth simplified (session → super_admin/owner AAL2 → render); IndexRedirect + LoginPage send each user to homeRoute(role) (super→/overview, cloud→/dashboard, onprem→/namespaces). onprem nav reordered (Namespaces first) to keep the home=first-nav invariant. README rewritten for the single app. Verified locally: all three demo users sign in via the same /login and resolve to the right role + landing route; ONE build; typecheck/lint/build green; no portal imports remain.
Decisions made: D-048
Known issues: — (cloud Supabase project URL/keys still user-provided; provisioned orgs shown via pending-invites panel until 6.5; metrics still mock via external_ref bridge)
