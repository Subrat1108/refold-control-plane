-- Phase 6.1 — RLS isolation test (build-spec-v2 § 5 verification)
--
-- Proves tenant isolation: a customer sees only their own org, never another
-- org's rows, while super_admin sees everything. Run against a freshly reset
-- local db (migrations + seed applied). See README "Supabase / RLS test".
--
-- Each block impersonates a seeded user by setting the request JWT claims that
-- Supabase's auth.uid()/auth.jwt() read, under the non-privileged `authenticated`
-- role (the table owner would bypass RLS). Any failed assert aborts with an error;
-- "ALL RLS TESTS PASSED" prints only if every assertion holds.

-- Seeded ids:
--   super_admin      1001 (internal org 0001)
--   Prism owner      1002 (Prism org   0002)
--   Meridian owner   1003 (Meridian org 0003)
